### Can the API/SDK send notifications back to our system using callbacks, notifications, pushes, or webhooks?

Because Route4Me processes all routes asynchronously, Route4Me will conveniently notify the endpoint you specify as the route optimization job progresses through each state of the optimization. Every stage of the route optimization process has a unique stage id.

### Does the Route4Me API and SDK work in my country?
Route4Me.com, as well as all of Route4Me’s mobile applications use the Route4Me SDK’s and API.
Since Route4Me works globally, this means that all of Route4Me’s capabilities are available using the SDK’s in every country 


### Will the Route4Me API/SDK work in my program on the Mac, PC, or Linux?
Customers are encouraged to select their preferred operating system environment. The Route4Me API/SDK will function on any operating system that supports the preferred programming language of the customer. At this point in time, almost every supported SDK can run on any operating system.


### Does the Route4Me API/SDK require me to buy my own servers?
Route4Me has its own computing infrastructure that you can access using the API and SDKs. Customers typically have to run the SDK code on their own computers and/or servers to access this infrastructure.

### Does Route4Me have an on-premise solution?
Route4Me does not currently lease or sell servers, and does not have on-premise appliance solution. This would only be possible in exceptionally unique scenarios.


### Does the Route4Me API/SDK require me to have my own programmers?
The time required to integrate the SDK can be as little as 1 hour or may take several weeks, depending on the number of features being incorporated into the customer’s application and how much integration testing will be done by the client. A programmer’s involvement is almost always required to use Route4Me’s technology when accessing it through the API.
